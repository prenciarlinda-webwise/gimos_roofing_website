    metaTitle: "Checking Florida Roofing Licenses: A Jacksonville Homeowner's Guide",
    excerpt: "Don't get stuck with a bad roof or a lawsuit. Here's exactly how to check a Florida roofing contractor's license and insurance in under 5 minutes.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Every year after hurricane season, Jacksonville neighborhoods get flooded with trucks from out of state. Some of these contractors are legitimate. Many are not. And by the time you figure out the difference, they've already cashed your check and moved on to the next zip code.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">In Florida, the rules are strict. To be a legitimate <strong>roofing contractor license Florida</strong> holder, you have to pass a state exam, carry specific insurance, and register with the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). But here's the thing: scammers know most homeowners won't bother to check.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">This guide will show you exactly how to verify a roofer's credentials in under 5 minutes, so you never have to wonder if you're dealing with a professional or a con artist.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Step 1: Get Their License Number (Not Just Their Word)</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A legitimate contractor will have their license number on their truck, their business card, and their contract. If you have to ask for it multiple times, that's your first red flag.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Florida roofing licenses start with "CCC" (for Certified) or "RC" (for Registered). Write this number down. You'll need it for the next step.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Step 2: Verify on the DBPR Website</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Go to <a href="https://www.myfloridalicense.com/wl11.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-primary hover:underline">MyFloridaLicense.com</a> and enter the license number. You'll see:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>The contractor's legal name and business name</li>
        <li>Whether their license is "Current, Active" (the only status you want to see)</li>
        <li>Any complaints or disciplinary actions</li>
        <li>When the license expires</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">If the license shows "Delinquent," "Suspended," or doesn't exist at all, end the conversation immediately.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Why "Registered" vs. "Certified" Matters for a Florida Roofing Contractor</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">This is where it gets important for Jacksonville homeowners:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Certified Contractors (CCC):</strong> Can work anywhere in Florida. They passed the state exam and meet all state requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Registered Contractors (RC):</strong> Can only work in specific counties where they've registered. They're licensed locally but haven't taken the state certification exam.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Both are legal, but if someone with an "RC" license from Tampa shows up in Jacksonville, they're working outside their jurisdiction. That's a problem for you if something goes wrong.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"I've seen so many homeowners in Jacksonville get burned by 'tailgate' contractors who disappear after the first rain. If their license number isn't on their truck, keep walking. And if they pressure you to sign today because of a 'storm damage deadline,' that's almost always a scam. Real contractors don't need to pressure you."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Step 3: Verify Their Insurance (Yes, Actually Call)</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A license isn't enough. You need to confirm they carry:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>General Liability Insurance:</strong> Covers damage to your property</li>
        <li><strong>Workers' Compensation:</strong> Covers injuries to workers on your property</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Ask for a Certificate of Insurance and actually call the insurance company to verify it's current. Scammers have been known to provide fake certificates or policies that lapsed months ago.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Step 4: Check for Complaints</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Beyond the DBPR website, search for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Better Business Bureau complaints</li>
        <li>Google Reviews (look for patterns in negative reviews)</li>
        <li>Local news stories (search their company name + "lawsuit" or "complaint")</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Understanding Roofing Contractor Requirements in Florida</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Florida has some of the strictest <strong>roofing contractor requirements</strong> in the country, and for good reason. Our roofs take a beating from hurricanes, tropical storms, and relentless sun.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Legal requirements include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Passing a state-approved examination</li>
        <li>Minimum $300,000 in general liability insurance</li>
        <li>Workers' compensation coverage for all employees</li>
        <li>Financial responsibility requirements</li>
        <li>Continuing education to maintain the license</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">When a contractor cuts corners on licensing, they're telling you they'll cut corners on your roof too.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Red Flags That Should End the Conversation</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>"We're only in town this week" - Legitimate contractors have permanent local operations</li>
        <li>"We can start today if you sign now" - High-pressure tactics are a scam signature</li>
        <li>"Pay in full upfront" - Never pay more than 10-20% as a deposit</li>
        <li>"We'll handle everything with your insurance" - You should always be involved in insurance claims</li>
        <li>"We don't do written contracts" - Every job needs a detailed written contract</li>
        <li>No physical address or only a P.O. Box - Real businesses have real locations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Checking a contractor's credentials takes 5 minutes. Dealing with a bad roof job or a legal nightmare can take years and cost thousands. Do your homework before signing anything.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">At Gimo's Roofing, we're happy to provide our license number, insurance certificates, and references before you even schedule an estimate. That's how it should work. If a contractor makes you feel weird for asking, find someone who doesn't. <a href="/about" class="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">Learn more about our licensed Jacksonville roofing contractor</a> credentials.</p>

    title: "Can't Pay for a New Roof Upfront? Here's How Our Financing Actually Works",
    metaTitle: "Roofing Contractors with Financing in Jacksonville | New Roof Options",
    excerpt: "A leaky roof doesn't wait for payday. See which roofing contractors that offer financing are right for you and how to get a new roof with monthly payments.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Let's be honest: most people don't have $15,000 sitting in a savings account waiting for a roof replacement. And that's okay. A leaky roof is an emergency, and emergencies don't care about your bank balance.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">The good news? You have options. Real options that don't involve draining your retirement or maxing out credit cards at 24% interest.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Are There Roofing Contractors That Offer Financing for Storm Damage?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Yes, but not all financing is created equal. Here's what you need to know about finding <strong>roofing contractors that offer financing</strong>:</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Third-Party Financing (What We Use):</strong> Companies like EnerBank, GreenSky, and Service Finance specialize in home improvement loans. These typically offer:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Fixed interest rates (often lower than credit cards)</li>
        <li>Terms from 12 months to 15 years</li>
        <li>Same-as-cash options if you pay within a promotional period</li>
        <li>Quick approval (often same-day)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>In-House Financing:</strong> Some contractors offer their own payment plans. Be careful here. Read the fine print for hidden fees or balloon payments.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6"><strong>Insurance + Financing Combo:</strong> If you have storm damage, insurance may cover part of your roof. Financing can cover your deductible and any upgrades insurance won't pay for.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"I've seen families put off roof repairs for years because they thought they couldn't afford it. Then a small leak becomes a major mold problem, and suddenly they're looking at a $30,000 bill instead of a $12,000 one. The monthly payment on financing is almost always cheaper than waiting."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">How Our Financing Process Works</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">At Gimo's Roofing, we partner with EnerBank USA to offer financing options that make sense for real families. Here's the step-by-step:</p>

      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Get Your Free Estimate:</strong> We come out, inspect your roof, and give you a detailed quote. No pressure, no obligation.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply for Financing:</strong> Takes about 5 minutes. You can do it on your phone. No hard credit pull for the initial application.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Approved:</strong> Most approvals come back within 24 hours. We'll go over your options together.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Your Terms:</strong> Pick a monthly payment that works for your budget. We offer terms from 12 months to 144 months.</li>
        <li><strong>We Start Work:</strong> Once approved, we schedule your project. You don't pay anything until the work is complete and you're satisfied.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">What Does a New Roof Actually Cost Per Month?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Let's look at real numbers for a typical Jacksonville home:</p>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-4">Example: $15,000 Roof Replacement</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
          <li><strong>12-month same-as-cash:</strong> $1,250/month (0% if paid in full)</li>
          <li><strong>60-month term at 7.99%:</strong> ~$304/month</li>
          <li><strong>120-month term at 9.99%:</strong> ~$198/month</li>
          <li><strong>144-month term at 11.99%:</strong> ~$189/month</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-4">*Rates shown are examples. Your actual rate depends on credit approval.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">What roofing companies offer financing near me?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">In Jacksonville, several reputable companies offer financing, including Gimo's Roofing. When researching <strong>what roofing companies offer financing</strong>, look for those who partner with established lenders rather than offering "in-house" financing with unclear terms.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Will applying hurt my credit score?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The initial application is usually a soft pull that doesn't affect your score. A hard pull only happens if you accept the loan and move forward.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">What if I have bad credit?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Options exist for various credit situations. Interest rates may be higher, but financing can still be more affordable than high-interest credit cards or waiting until a small problem becomes a big one.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Can I pay it off early?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Yes. There are no prepayment penalties with the financing options we offer.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Other Ways to Pay for a New Roof</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Insurance Claims:</strong> If your roof was damaged by a storm, hurricane, or fallen tree, your homeowner's insurance may cover replacement.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Equity Loan/HELOC:</strong> If you have equity in your home, this can offer lower rates than unsecured financing.</li>
        <li><strong>FHA Title I Loans:</strong> Government-backed loans for home improvements up to $25,000.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Assistance Programs:</strong> Some Jacksonville programs help seniors or low-income homeowners with emergency repairs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">If you're looking for <strong>new roof financing</strong>, it usually takes less than 24 hours to get approved. Don't let cost anxiety turn a small repair into a catastrophic failure. The monthly payment on a financed roof is almost always cheaper than the water damage, mold remediation, and structural repairs you'll face if you wait too long.</p>

    title: "The 10 Questions I Wish Every Homeowner Would Ask Me During an Estimate",
    metaTitle: "Questions to Ask a Roofing Contractor | Hiring Tips for 2025",
    excerpt: "Don't hire a roofer based on price alone. Use these critical questions to ask a roofing contractor to make sure your home is in the right hands.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Most people don't know the right <strong>questions to ask a roofing contractor</strong>, so they just look at the bottom number. I get it. Roofing isn't something you think about until you need it. But the lowest bid often costs you the most in the long run.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">After years of providing estimates in Jacksonville, I've put together the questions that separate informed homeowners from those who end up calling us to fix someone else's mess.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 1: "Can I See Your Florida Roofing License?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">This should be automatic. The license number should be on their truck, their card, and their estimate. If they hesitate, thank them for their time and show them the door.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 2: "What's Your Workers' Comp Policy Number?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">If a worker gets hurt on your property and the contractor doesn't have workers' comp, guess who gets sued? You. Ask for the policy number and verify it's active.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 3: "Who Will Actually Be Doing the Work?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Some companies are "brokers" who sell jobs and subcontract everything. Others have their own crews. Neither is automatically bad, but you should know:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Will the person giving me this estimate be at my house during the job?</li>
        <li>How long has your crew been working together?</li>
        <li>Are your workers employees or subcontractors?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"When you're learning how to choose the right roofing contractor, watch how they treat your questions. A good contractor welcomes them. A shady one gets annoyed or evasive. Your gut feeling matters here."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 4: "What Happens If It Rains During the Job?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">In Florida, afternoon storms are a given. A professional contractor has a plan. They should be able to tell you exactly how they protect your home if they need to stop mid-job.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 5: "What's Included in This Price?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Cheap estimates often hide costs. Make sure you understand:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Is tear-off of the old roof included, or are they going over it?</li>
        <li>Are they replacing damaged decking? How much is included before extra charges?</li>
        <li>What about flashing, vents, and pipe boots?</li>
        <li>Who handles the permit and inspections?</li>
        <li>Is debris removal and dumpster rental included?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 6: "What Materials Are You Using?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Understanding <strong>how to choose the right roofing contractor</strong> means understanding what they're putting on your house. Ask for specifics:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Brand and product line of shingles (e.g., GAF Timberline HDZ, Owens Corning Duration)</li>
        <li>What type of underlayment?</li>
        <li>What ice and water shield are they using around penetrations?</li>
        <li>What's the ventilation plan?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 7: "What Warranties Do I Get?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">There are two types of warranties, and you need both:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Manufacturer Warranty:</strong> Covers defects in the shingles themselves. Length depends on the product (25-50 years typical).</li>
        <li><strong>Workmanship Warranty:</strong> Covers the contractor's installation work. This is where companies differ. Get the length and terms in writing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 8: "Can I See Some Recent Projects Nearby?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A contractor who's been working in Jacksonville should have no problem pointing you to a recent job in your area. Bonus points if they can connect you with a homeowner reference.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 9: "What's Your Payment Schedule?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Red flags:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Demanding full payment upfront</li>
        <li>Cash-only requirements</li>
        <li>No written contract</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A normal payment schedule is a small deposit (10-20%) with the balance due upon completion. Some contractors take payment at material delivery. Get it in writing either way.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Question 10: "What Happens If There's a Problem After You're Done?"</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Ask about their callback policy. How quickly do they respond to warranty issues? Is there a different number to call? What's considered warranty work vs. new damage?</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Bonus: Trust Your Instincts</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Beyond these questions, pay attention to how the contractor conducts themselves:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Did they show up on time for the estimate?</li>
        <li>Did they actually get on the roof or just look from the ground?</li>
        <li>Did they explain things in plain language?</li>
        <li>Did they pressure you to sign immediately?</li>
        <li>Did their estimate come in writing with itemized details?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">How to Choose a Good Commercial Roofing Contractor</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">If you're a business owner or property manager, the stakes are even higher. <strong>How to choose a good commercial roofing contractor</strong> involves additional considerations:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Experience with your roof type:</strong> Commercial roofs (TPO, EPDM, modified bitumen) require specialized knowledge. Ask for commercial-specific references.</li>
        <li><strong>Ability to work around operations:</strong> Can they complete work during off-hours or in phases to minimize business disruption?</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance programs:</strong> Do they offer ongoing maintenance contracts? Commercial roofs need regular inspections.</li>
        <li><strong>Project management capabilities:</strong> Large commercial projects need proper coordination. Ask about their project management process.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance limits:</strong> Commercial projects require higher liability limits. Verify their coverage matches your needs.</li>

    title: "Flat Roofing Contractor: Why Flat Roofs Leak More Than Shingles",
    metaTitle: "Jacksonville Flat Roofing Contractor | Repair & Installation Guide",
    excerpt: "Flat roofs are tricky. Find out why you need a specialized flat roofing contractor for your Florida home and the best materials to use.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">If you have a porch, a garage extension, a modern home addition, or a commercial building, you probably have a flat roof somewhere. And if you've owned it long enough, you've probably dealt with a leak.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Here's the truth: flat roofs aren't actually flat. They have a slight slope to drain water. But compared to a pitched shingle roof, they're much more likely to develop problems if not installed and maintained correctly. That's why you need a <strong>flat roofing contractor</strong> who understands the specialized membranes and techniques required.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Need a <a href="/services/commercial-roofing" class="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">specialized commercial flat roofing</a> solution for your business? We handle both residential and commercial flat roof projects.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Why Flat Roofs Are Different</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">On a steep shingle roof, gravity does most of the work. Water runs off before it can cause problems. On a flat roof, water sits. It pools. It finds every tiny imperfection and exploits it.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">People often ask, "<strong>What does a roofing contractor do</strong> differently for a flat roof vs. a sloped one?" The answer is: everything. Different materials, different installation techniques, different maintenance requirements.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"I see it all the time: someone gets a cheap price on a flat roof repair, and six months later, the same spot is leaking again. Flat roofs require specialized knowledge. If your contractor mainly does shingles and treats flat roofing as a side job, you're asking for trouble."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Common Causes of Flat Roof Leaks</h2>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">1. Ponding Water</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">If water sits on your roof for more than 48 hours after rain, you have a ponding problem. This accelerates membrane deterioration and eventually finds a way inside.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">2. Membrane Damage</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Florida's UV exposure is brutal. Over time, it breaks down roofing membranes, causing cracks and splits. Add in foot traffic from HVAC maintenance, and you have wear points.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">3. Flashing Failures</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Where your flat roof meets walls, vents, or other penetrations, flashing creates a waterproof seal. When this fails, water gets behind the membrane.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">4. Poor Original Installation</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Many flat roof problems trace back to shortcuts during installation. Seams that weren't properly bonded. Inadequate slope for drainage. Wrong materials for the application.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Best Materials for Florida Flat Roofs</h2>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Best for:</strong> Most residential and commercial flat roofs in Florida</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">TPO has become the industry standard for flat roofing. It's heat-welded at the seams (creating a watertight bond), reflects UV rays to keep buildings cooler, and handles Florida's climate well. White TPO is especially popular for energy efficiency.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">EPDM (Rubber Roofing)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-conscious projects, smaller flat sections</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">EPDM has been around for decades and has a good track record. It's less expensive than TPO but requires more maintenance. The seams are glued rather than welded, which can be a weak point over time.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Modified Bitumen</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Best for:</strong> Areas with heavy foot traffic, commercial applications</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Think of this as an evolved version of old-school tar roofing. It comes in rolls and is torch-applied or self-adhered. It's durable and repairable but requires skilled installation.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Silicone Coating</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Best for:</strong> Restoring existing flat roofs without full replacement</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">If your existing flat roof is structurally sound but showing age, a silicone coating can extend its life by 10-15 years at a fraction of replacement cost.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">What About Tile or Metal?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">While we're discussing specialized roofing, it's worth noting that a <strong>tile roofing contractor</strong> handles yet another specialty. Tile roofs (common on Florida Mediterranean-style homes) require their own expertise. If you have a tile roof and need repairs, make sure your contractor has specific tile experience, not just general roofing knowledge.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Signs You Need Flat Roof Repair</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Water stains on interior ceilings below the flat roof</li>
        <li>Visible ponding water 48+ hours after rain</li>
        <li>Bubbles, blisters, or soft spots in the membrane</li>
        <li>Separated or curling seams</li>
        <li>Cracks in the surface material</li>
        <li>Flashing pulling away from walls or curbs</li>
        <li>Musty odors in rooms below the flat roof</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Repair vs. Replace: How to Decide</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Repair makes sense when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Damage is localized to one area</li>
        <li>The roof is less than 15 years old</li>
        <li>No widespread ponding issues</li>
        <li>The deck underneath is solid</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Replacement makes sense when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Multiple areas are failing</li>
        <li>The roof is 20+ years old</li>
        <li>Chronic leaks despite repairs</li>
        <li>Underlying deck damage</li>
        <li>You're tired of throwing money at recurring problems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Maintenance That Extends Flat Roof Life</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Quarterly inspections:</strong> Especially after major storms</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it clean:</strong> Remove debris that traps moisture</li>
        <li><strong>Trim overhanging branches:</strong> Prevents damage and debris accumulation</li>
        <li><strong>Check drainage:</strong> Ensure scuppers and drains are clear</li>
        <li><strong>Address small issues immediately:</strong> A $200 repair now beats a $10,000 replacement later</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Flat roofs aren't harder to maintain than shingle roofs, but they are different. Finding a contractor who specializes in flat roofing, or at least has significant experience with the materials involved, is essential.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">At Gimo's Roofing, we work on flat roofs regularly, from small porch sections to large commercial buildings. We're happy to inspect your flat roof and give you an honest assessment of repair vs. replacement options.</p>

    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Your roof is one of the most critical components of your home, protecting you and your family from the elements. But how do you know when it's time to replace it?</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">1. Age of Your Roof</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Most asphalt shingle roofs last 20-25 years in Florida's climate. If your roof is approaching or exceeding this age, it's time to start planning for a replacement.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">2. Missing or Damaged Shingles</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">After storms, check your roof for missing shingles. A few can be repaired, but widespread damage often indicates the roof is failing.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">3. Granules in Your Gutters</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">As shingles age, they shed protective granules. Excessive granules in your gutters means your shingles are nearing end of life.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">4. Sagging Roof Deck</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A sagging roof requires immediate attention. This indicates structural damage from water infiltration.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">5. Light Through the Attic</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">If you see daylight through roof boards in the attic, water can get in too. This is a clear sign of roof failure.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>

    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Metal roofing has become increasingly popular among Florida homeowners, and for good reason.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Hurricane Resistance</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Metal roofs can withstand winds up to 140 mph or more, making them ideal for Florida's hurricane season.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Longevity</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">While asphalt shingles last 20-25 years, metal roofs can last 50-70 years with minimal maintenance.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Energy Efficiency</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Metal roofs reflect solar heat, potentially reducing cooling costs by 10-25% in Jacksonville's hot climate.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"Metal roofing costs more upfront, but when you factor in the 50+ year lifespan and energy savings, it often costs less over time than replacing shingle roofs every 20 years."</p>

    excerpt: "San Marco and St. Augustine homes weren't built for shingles. Learn why you need a specialist tile roofing contractor for Mediterranean-style homes.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Drive through San Marco, St. Augustine, or any of Jacksonville's historic neighborhoods, and you'll see something shingle contractors don't know how to handle: tile roofs. Those beautiful terracotta, clay, and concrete tiles that give Florida homes their distinctive Mediterranean character.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">Here's the problem: most roofing companies treat tile like oversized shingles. They walk on them wrong, crack them during installation, and use the wrong underlayment. That's why finding a genuine <strong>tile roofing contractor</strong> matters so much.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Why Tile Roofs Require Specialized Expertise</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Tile roofing isn't just a different material. It's a completely different system:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Weight considerations:</strong> Tile roofs weigh 600-1,100 lbs per square (100 sq ft), compared to 200-350 lbs for asphalt. Your roof structure must be engineered to handle this.</li>
        <li><strong>Underlayment requirements:</strong> Tile roofs need specific high-temperature underlayment that won't degrade under the tiles' heat absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Walking techniques:</strong> Walking improperly on tile will crack it. Experienced tile contractors know where and how to walk.</li>
        <li><strong>Flashing details:</strong> Tile roofs require specialized flashing methods around penetrations and valleys.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"I've seen beautiful San Marco homes ruined by contractors who thought they could treat tile like shingles. They walk across the roof, crack 20 tiles, then try to hide it with caulk. Six months later, you have leaks everywhere. Always ask a contractor how many tile roofs they've done in the last year."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Types of Tile Roofing We Install</h2>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Clay Tile</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">The traditional choice for Mediterranean and Spanish Colonial homes. Clay tiles offer unmatched longevity (50-100+ years) and that authentic terracotta look. They're heavier and more expensive but worth it for historic or high-end properties.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Concrete Tile</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A more affordable alternative that mimics clay's appearance. Concrete tiles last 40-50 years and come in various profiles (flat, barrel, S-tile) and colors. Popular for new construction wanting the tile look at a lower cost.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-secondary mt-6 mb-2">Synthetic/Composite Tile</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Modern materials that look like clay or slate but weigh significantly less. Ideal for structures that can't support traditional tile weight. Lifespan of 30-50 years.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Common Tile Roof Problems in Jacksonville</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Cracked tiles:</strong> Usually from foot traffic, fallen branches, or improper installation</li>
        <li><strong>Underlayment failure:</strong> The hidden layer under tiles degrades over time, causing leaks even with intact tiles</li>
        <li><strong>Flashing deterioration:</strong> Metal flashing around vents and chimneys corrodes in Florida's humidity</li>
        <li><strong>Ridge cap issues:</strong> Mortar holding ridge tiles can crack and allow water infiltration</li>
        <li><strong>Hurricane damage:</strong> High winds can lift and displace tiles, especially if not properly secured</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Tile Roof Repair vs. Replacement</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Repair makes sense when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Damage is limited to a few cracked or broken tiles</li>
        <li>Underlayment is still in good condition (inspect from attic)</li>
        <li>Roof is under 40 years old</li>
        <li>No widespread structural issues</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Replacement makes sense when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Underlayment is failing (this is common after 20-30 years)</li>
        <li>Multiple areas show tile degradation</li>
        <li>Roof deck damage from long-term leaks</li>
        <li>Insurance is covering storm damage (often makes sense to replace entirely)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Questions to Ask a Tile Roofing Contractor</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>How many tile roofs have you installed or repaired in the past year?</li>
        <li>Do you have experience with my specific tile type (clay, concrete, S-tile)?</li>
        <li>What underlayment do you use under tile roofs?</li>
        <li>How do you protect existing tiles during repair work?</li>
        <li>Can you match my existing tile color and profile for repairs?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Your tile roof is an investment that can last a century with proper care. Don't trust it to a contractor who primarily does shingles. The installation techniques, materials, and knowledge required are completely different.</p>

    metaTitle: "Storm Damage Roofing Contractor Insurance Guide | Jacksonville FL",
    excerpt: "What your adjuster isn't telling you about wind damage. A guide by a top-rated storm damage roofing contractor.",
    content: `
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">After every hurricane or major storm in Jacksonville, the phone starts ringing. Homeowners are confused, frustrated, and getting different stories from their insurance company than what they're seeing on their roof.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">As a <strong>storm damage roofing contractor</strong>, we've worked through countless insurance claims. Here's what we wish every homeowner knew before their adjuster shows up.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">How Insurance Companies Handle Roof Claims</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">First, understand that insurance adjusters work for the insurance company, not you. Their job is to settle claims fairly, but also to protect the company's bottom line. That's not necessarily bad, but you need to know the game.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Most adjusters aren't roofing experts. They use software programs that calculate repair costs based on inputs. If they miss damage or underestimate scope, your settlement will be too low.</p>

      <div class="bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="font-bold text-secondary mb-2">Gimo's Take:</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">"The biggest mistake I see? Homeowners accepting the first check without question. Insurance companies expect negotiation. That initial estimate is often a starting point, not a final offer. Get a contractor's assessment before agreeing to anything."</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">What Adjusters Often Miss</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Soft metal damage:</strong> Hail and debris dent vents, flashing, and gutters. These need replacement, not just roof shingles.</li>
        <li><strong>Interior damage:</strong> Water stains, wet insulation, and attic damage are covered but often overlooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Code upgrades:</strong> If your roof needs replacement, Florida code may require upgrades (better underlayment, hurricane clips). This should be covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Matching:</strong> If your shingles are discontinued, the entire roof side may need replacement to match.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper ventilation:</strong> Damaged vents need replacement with code-compliant alternatives.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Timeline That Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Florida law gives you specific timeframes:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Report the claim promptly:</strong> Most policies require "prompt" notification, typically within 14 days of discovering damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Take photos and videos immediately after the storm, before any temporary repairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Get contractor estimates:</strong> Have a licensed contractor inspect before the adjuster visit if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplement deadline:</strong> You can submit additional damage findings (supplements) after the initial estimate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">When to Get a Storm Damage Roofing Contractor Involved</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Ideally, before the adjuster visit. Here's why:</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">Red Flags: Storm Chasers to Avoid</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">After every storm, out-of-state contractors flood Jacksonville. Watch out for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>"We'll handle everything with your insurance" - You should always be involved</li>
        <li>Pressure to sign immediately - Legitimate contractors don't need to rush you</li>
        <li>Offering to waive your deductible - This is insurance fraud</li>
        <li>No local address or Florida license - Verify at MyFloridaLicense.com</li>
        <li>Asking for full payment upfront - Never pay more than 10-20% deposit</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Learn how to <a href="/blog/how-to-check-florida-roofing-license" class="text-primary hover:underline font-semibold">verify a Florida roofing contractor's license</a> before signing anything.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">What a Top-Rated Storm Damage Roofing Contractor Does Differently</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A reputable <strong>top-rated storm damage roofing contractor</strong> will:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Provide a free, thorough inspection before you commit to anything</li>
        <li>Document all damage with detailed photos and written scope</li>
        <li>Explain what's covered and what isn't in plain language</li>
        <li>Work with your insurance adjuster professionally</li>
        <li>Submit supplements for missed items</li>
        <li>Stand behind their work with proper warranties</li>
        <li>Be there for you next year when you need them again</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Supplement Process Explained</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">A "supplement" is a request for additional payment after the initial estimate. Common reasons include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
        <li>Hidden damage discovered during work (rotted decking, etc.)</li>
        <li>Code-required upgrades not included in original estimate</li>
        <li>Missed items like gutters, interior damage, or landscaping</li>
        <li>Price increases for materials between estimate and work date</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">A good contractor knows how to document and submit supplements properly. This is normal and expected in the insurance process.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mt-10 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">You pay for insurance to protect your home. When storm damage happens, you deserve fair compensation for proper repairs. Don't accept less because you didn't know the process or had the wrong contractor.</p>
